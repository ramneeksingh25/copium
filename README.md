## Problem Statement

Post-pandemic, the world has changed significantly. Quick access to quality, affordable, and reliable healthcare from anywhere is the need of the hour. People are often confined to remote locations in their homes, leading to an urgent need for a digitally enabled solution that addresses the following:

2. **Patient Information Capture**: Collect basic patient information and the specific specialty for which Telehealth consultation is needed.
3. **Payment Processing**: Accept payments for the Telehealth consultation before the actual consultation begins.
4. **Privacy and Security**: Ensure no compromise in the privacy of the consultation involving PHI data and the ability to securely save the information for future reference.
5. **In-App Chat and Information Sharing**: Enable chat and information sharing from within the application during the Telehealth session.
6. **Transcription Service**: Overcome challenges of differences in dialect/accent in remote consultation via a transcription service.
